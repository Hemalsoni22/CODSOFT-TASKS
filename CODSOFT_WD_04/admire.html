        Maharana Pratap was a Rajput king of Mewar in northwestern India. Born
        on May 9, 1540, he is remembered for his resistance against the Mughal
        emperor Akbar. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, Maharana
        Pratap refused to submit to Mughal rule, exemplifying bravery, honor,
        and a commitment to his people.
